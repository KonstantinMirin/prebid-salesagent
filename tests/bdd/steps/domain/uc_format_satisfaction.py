"""Steps for BR-UC-FORMAT-SATISFACTION: a package selector against a canonical declaration.

Setup stores a REAL dual-arm ``products`` row through ``ProductFactory`` -- the same factory
every other product fixture uses -- and dispatch reuses the shared "the Buyer Agent sends
the create_media_buy request" When from ``uc002_create_media_buy``. The refusal is read off
the WIRE through ``assert_wire_error``, which is the sanctioned error surface.

TWO TABLES, and both of them are DATA rather than behaviour: one maps a declaration name to
the ``format_options`` document the seller stores, the other maps a selector name to the
package members the buyer sends. They are stored documents and request members -- the
faithful shapes -- not a registry of objects a factory should be building:
``core/product-format-declaration.json`` generates a sixteen-branch discriminated union over
``format_kind``, so the column holds a document and the model picks its branch on readback.
Naming each row lets the feature's Examples say which rule it is exercising instead of
carrying JSON a reader has to decode.
